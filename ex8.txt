File Transfer Protocol (FTP): FTP allows users to transfer files from one machine to another. 
Types of files may include program files,multimedia files, text files, and documents, etc.

Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP): HTTP is designed for transferring a hypertext among two 
or more systems. HTML tags are used for creating links. These links may be in any form like 
text or images. HTTP is designed on Client-server principles which allow a client system for 
establishing a connection with the server machine for making a request. The server acknowledges
 the request initiated by the client and responds accordingly

Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS): HTTPS is abbreviated as Hyper Text Transfer 
Protocol Secure is a standard protocol to secure the communication among two computers 
one using the browser and other fetching data from web server. HTTP is used for transferring 
data between the client browser (request) and the web server (response) in the hypertext format,
 same in case of HTTPS except that the transferring of data is done in an encrypted format. 
 So it can be said that https thwart hackers from interpretation or modification of data 
 throughout the transfer of packets.

User Datagram Protocol (UDP): UDP is a substitute communication protocol to Transmission 
Control Protocol implemented primarily for creating loss-tolerating and low-latency linking 
between different applications.

Internet Protocol (IP): IP is designed explicitly as addressing protocol. It is mostly used 
with TCP. The IP addresses in packets help in routing them through different nodes in a 
network until it reaches the destination system. TCP/IP is the most popular protocol connecting
 the networks.
